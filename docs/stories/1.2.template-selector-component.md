## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- TypeScript interfaces successfully created for template system with full Unity integration
- Template system types support Unity AR integration requirements and maintain backward compatibility
- Type validation confirmed through TypeScript compilation
- File structure pattern established: `BOLT/src/types/templates.ts` and component organization in `BOLT/src/components/`

### Architecture Context
Based on comprehensive architecture analysis, this story implements the TemplateSelector component as part of the core template system foundation for the AR Education Platform enhancement.

**Project Structure Context:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Source Tree Integration]
- Target location: `BOLT/src/components/templates/TemplateSelector.tsx`
- Must integrate with existing React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.5.3 setup
- Follows existing camelCase naming patterns from current codebase
- Use barrel exports pattern: `BOLT/src/components/templates/index.ts`

**Technology Stack Integration:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- **React:** 18.3.1 - Maintain existing React patterns from StepPreview component
- **TypeScript:** 5.5.3 - Use Template and TemplateSlot interfaces from types/templates.ts
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4.1 - Use existing utility classes for grid layouts
- **Icons:** Lucide React 0.344.0 - For template visualization and content type indicators
- **Build:** Vite 6.3.5 - No changes required to existing build process

**Component Architecture Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Component Architecture]

**TemplateSelector Component Specifications:**
- **Responsibility:** Template browsing and selection UI with visual slot preview
- **Integration:** Integrates with StepPreview layout mode state management
- **Key Interfaces:**
  - `selectedTemplate?: string` - Currently active template identifier
  - `onTemplateSelect(templateId: string): void` - Template selection callback
  - `availableTemplates: Template[]` - Available template definitions from types/templates.ts

**Template Preview Visualization Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Template Definition Model]
- Display template slots using visual positioning based on Unity coordinates
- Show slot positions with CSS Grid/Flexbox layout representation
- Use Lucide React icons to represent allowed content types per slot
- Visual indicators for required vs optional slots
- Template name and basic metadata display

**Responsive Design Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Infrastructure and Deployment Integration]
- Desktop viewports: 3-4 column grid layout
- Tablet viewports: 2-3 column grid layout  
- Mobile considerations: Single column layout (future consideration)
- Maintain existing TailwindCSS responsive patterns from current components

**Unity Integration Context:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Data Models and Schema Changes]
- Templates use Unity coordinate system positioning (x, y, z) for slot definitions
- Visual preview should represent slot positions relative to template boundaries
- Content type validation using ContentType enum from templates.ts
- Support for template scale factors and content limits

**Data Integration Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Enhanced ARContent Model]
- Work with Template interface: `{id, name, slots, unityScale, contentLimits}`
- Each TemplateSlot: `{id, position: Vector3, size: Dimensions, contentTypes: ContentType[], required: boolean}`
- Integration with existing ARContent system for backward compatibility

**File Locations:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Source Tree Integration]
- Component: `BOLT/src/components/templates/TemplateSelector.tsx`
- Barrel export: `BOLT/src/components/templates/index.ts`
- Types import: `import { Template, TemplateSlot, ContentType } from '../../types/templates'`

### Testing
**Testing Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
- No existing test framework identified in current project
- Architecture recommends implementing Jest + React Testing Library
- Test file location: `src/components/templates/__tests__/TemplateSelector.test.tsx` (when testing framework added)

**Specific Testing for this Story:**
- Template grid rendering with various template counts
- Template selection callback functionality and state management  
- Responsive grid layout behavior at different breakpoints
- Lucide React icon rendering for content type visualization
- Template preview visual accuracy
- Component prop validation and TypeScript compilation

**Technical Constraints:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- React 18.3.1 compatibility requirements
- TypeScript 5.5.3 strict type checking
- TailwindCSS 3.4.1 utility class patterns
- Lucide React 0.344.0 icon integration
- Maintain performance equivalent to existing StepPreview component
