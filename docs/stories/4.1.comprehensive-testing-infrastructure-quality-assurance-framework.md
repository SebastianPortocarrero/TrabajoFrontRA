## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic-1 through Epic-3 implementation, the system has complex interactions between template components, Unity integration, AI recommendations, and collaborative features. Testing infrastructure must validate these interactions comprehensively while maintaining performance standards established in previous stories.

### Current Technology Stack Analysis
**Existing Dependencies** [Source: BOLT/package.json]:
- React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.5.3 (primary frontend stack)
- Current testing: NO testing framework currently installed
- Build system: Vite 6.3.5 with TypeScript support
- Component libraries: lucide-react, react-draggable, react-resizable
- Real-time: socket.io-client for collaboration features

### Required Testing Dependencies Installation

```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- 90% minimum code coverage across all components
- 100% coverage for critical Unity integration functions
- 100% coverage for Google Drive API integration
- 80% coverage for UI components with focus on user interactions

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework Configuration**:
- Jest with TypeScript support via ts-jest
- React Testing Library for component testing with user behavior simulation  
- JSDOM environment for browser API mocking
- Custom testing utilities for Google Drive and Unity API mocking

**Testing Patterns to Follow**:
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for test structure
- Mock external dependencies (Google Drive, Unity, AI services)
- Test user interactions over implementation details
- Integration testing for component communication
- Performance testing for Unity export benchmarks (<2s requirement)
