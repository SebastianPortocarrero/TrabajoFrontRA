- Performance target: <2s for complex layouts with >20 content items

**Unity Data Format Optimization** [Source: docs/architecture.md#unity-json-format]:
```json
{
  "markerId": "marker_123",
  "version": "1.0",
  "layout": {
    "mode": "template",
    "templateId": "grid_2x2",
    "worldScale": 1.0,
    "contents": [
      {
        "id": "content_1",
        "type": "button",
        "slotId": "top_left",
        "unityPosition": {"x": -0.5, "y": 0.5, "z": 0},
        "data": {"title": "Click Me", "action": "navigate"},
