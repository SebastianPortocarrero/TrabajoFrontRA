## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic-1 and Epic-2 completion, the template system and Unity integration are established. This story builds upon the existing StepPreview component and Google Drive storage system to add analytics capabilities.

### Data Models
**Performance Metrics Data Structure** [Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:
- Extend existing Google Drive JSON schema with performance metrics
- Metrics storage location: `Google Drive: AR_Projects/{userId}/analytics/performance_metrics.json`
- Template usage tracking integrated with existing Template Definition Model
- Unity export metrics linked to existing ARContent Model with unityPosition data

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Template load times and selection frequency
- StepPreview rendering performance
- Unity JSON export duration and success rates
- Google Drive API response times
- User interaction patterns with template system

### API Specifications
**New Analytics Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture.md#infrastructure-and-deployment-integration]:
- Extend existing Express.js backend with analytics routes
- GET /api/analytics/performance - Retrieve performance metrics
- GET /api/analytics/unity-exports - Unity export specific metrics
- POST /api/analytics/metrics - Submit new performance data
- All endpoints use existing Google Drive API authentication patterns

### Component Specifications
**PerformanceMetricsDashboard Component** [Source: docs/architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- Location: `BOLT/src/components/analytics/PerformanceMetricsDashboard.tsx`
- Props: `timeRange: string, userId: string, onDataExport: () => void`
- State management: Use existing React patterns, no complex state library needed
- Styling: TailwindCSS classes consistent with existing components

**Dashboard Layout Integration**:
- Add to existing navigation structure in main Layout component
- Use existing Lucide React icons for dashboard UI elements
- Maintain responsive design patterns established in current components

### File Locations
