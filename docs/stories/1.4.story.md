### Architecture Context
Based on comprehensive architecture analysis, this story enhances the StepPreview component to support dual-mode rendering (template vs freeform) while maintaining Unity integration for the AR Education Platform.

**Project Structure Context:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Source Tree Integration]
- Target file: `BOLT/src/components/StepPreview.tsx` (enhancement of existing component)
- Must integrate with React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.5.3 existing setup
- Follows existing camelCase naming patterns from current codebase
- Integrates with template components from `BOLT/src/components/templates/`

**Technology Stack Integration:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- **React:** 18.3.1 - Maintain existing React functional component patterns for StepPreview
- **TypeScript:** 5.5.3 - Extend existing StepPreview interface with new layoutMode prop
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4.1 - Use existing utility classes for template slot positioning
- **Drag/Drop:** React Draggable 4.4.6 - **MAINTAIN** for free-form mode backward compatibility
- **Resize:** React Resizable 3.0.5 - **MAINTAIN** for free-form mode backward compatibility
- **Build:** Vite 6.3.5 - No changes required to existing build process

**Component Architecture Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Component Architecture]

**Enhanced StepPreview Component Specifications:**
- **Responsibility:** Orchestrate both template and freeform rendering modes for AR content
- **Integration:** Central component integrating all template functionality with existing drag/drop
- **Enhanced Interfaces:**
  - All existing props maintained for backward compatibility
  - `layoutMode: LayoutMode` - Controls rendering approach ('template' | 'freeform')
  - `selectedTemplate?: Template` - Active template for slot-based rendering
  - `onUnityExport?: () => UnityARData` - Generate Unity-compatible data format

**Template Mode Rendering:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- **Slot Positioning:** CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts based on Template slot definitions
- **Unity Coordinates:** Use predefined Unity world coordinates from TemplateSlot model
- **Content Assignment:** Map ARContent to slots via slotId property
- **Overflow Handling:** Graceful handling of content that exceeds template slot limits

**Free-form Mode Preservation:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Tech Stack Alignment]
- **Existing Behavior:** Maintain current drag/drop functionality with React Draggable and React Resizable
- **Backward Compatibility:** Preserve all existing ARContent position-based rendering
- **Performance:** No regression in existing drag/drop responsiveness

**Data Models Integration:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Data Models and Schema Changes]

**Template Definition Model Usage:**
- `id: string` - Template identifier for selectedTemplate prop
- `slots: TemplateSlot[]` - Array of predefined content slots with Unity coordinates
- `unityScale: number` - Scale factor for Unity world positioning
- `contentLimits: Record<ContentType, number>` - Content limits per template

**Enhanced ARContent Model Usage:**
- All existing ARContent properties maintained for backward compatibility
- `slotId?: string` - Template slot assignment (template mode)
- `unityPosition?: Vector3` - Unity world coordinates (both modes)
- `googleDriveAssets: {main: string, thumbnail?: string}` - Google Drive file IDs

**Unity JSON Export Format:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Data Models and Schema Changes]
```json
{
  "markerId": "marker_123",
  "version": "1.0",
  "layout": {
    "mode": "template" | "freeform",
    "templateId": "grid_2x2", // if template mode
    "worldScale": 1.0,
    "contents": [
      {
        "id": "content_1",
        "type": "button",
        "slotId": "top_left", // if template mode
        "unityPosition": {"x": -0.5, "y": 0.5, "z": 0},
        "data": {"title": "Click Me", "action": "navigate"},
        "assets": {"main": "googleDriveFileId123"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Mode Switching Logic:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- **Data Preservation:** Content data must be preserved without loss during mode transitions
- **Position Mapping:** Convert between position-based and slot-based arrangements
- **Template Assignment:** Automatic or manual assignment of content to available slots
- **Fallback Handling:** Content that doesn't fit template slots should be handled gracefully

**Integration with Template Components:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- **LayoutModeToggle:** Receives mode changes via onModeChange callback
- **TemplateSelector:** Receives template selection via onTemplateSelect callback
- **Template System:** Integrates with template definitions and slot rendering

**File Locations:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Source Tree Integration]
- Component: `BOLT/src/components/StepPreview.tsx` (existing file to be enhanced)
- Types import: From `BOLT/src/types/templates.ts` and existing types
- Template components: From `BOLT/src/components/templates/index.ts`

### Testing
**Testing Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
