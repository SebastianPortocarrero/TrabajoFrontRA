# Epic 2: Advanced Template Management & Content Workflows

## Epic Overview
**Duration:** Week 3-4  
**Phase:** Enhancement Phase  
**Goal:** Enhance the established template system with advanced content creation workflows, template management capabilities, and improved Unity integration for efficient AR content development.

## Epic Description
Build upon Epic-1's foundation to provide content creators with powerful template management tools, guided content creation workflows, and enhanced Unity integration features that streamline the AR content development process while maintaining system integrity.

## User Stories

### Story 2.1: Template Library Management System
**As a** content creator  
**I want** a comprehensive template library with categorization, search, and custom template creation capabilities  
**so that** I can quickly discover, organize, and create templates that fit my specific AR content needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Template library component displays available templates in categorized groups (Education, Marketing, Tutorial, Custom)
2. Search functionality filters templates by name, category, and content type support
3. Template preview shows visual representation of slot layout with dimensions
4. Custom template creation wizard guides users through defining slots and properties
5. Template metadata includes creation date, usage count, and compatibility tags
6. Templates can be saved, edited, and deleted with proper validation
7. Integration with existing TemplateSelector component from Epic-1 maintains backward compatibility
8. Library supports import/export of template configurations for sharing
9. Responsive design works across desktop and tablet viewports using TailwindCSS patterns

### Story 2.2: Content Workflow Assistant  
**As a** content creator  
**I want** guided content creation workflows with validation and Unity optimization suggestions  
**so that** I can efficiently create AR content with confidence that it will work optimally in Unity without technical expertise

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Workflow assistant component provides step-by-step guidance for content creation process
2. Content validation checks template slot requirements and warns about missing content
3. Unity optimization suggestions analyze content placement and recommend improvements
4. Progress indicator shows completion status of content creation steps
5. Real-time validation feedback prevents common Unity integration issues
6. Content type recommendations suggest optimal content for each slot type
7. Integration with existing StepPreview component maintains drag-drop functionality
8. Assistant can be toggled on/off to support both guided and free-form workflows
9. Workflow saves progress and allows resuming interrupted content creation sessions

### Story 2.3: Advanced Unity Integration & Export
**As a** AR developer  
**I want** enhanced Unity data export with optimized coordinates, batch operations, and preview functionality  
**so that** I can efficiently integrate AR content into Unity projects with minimal manual processing and optimal performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enhanced export system generates Unity-optimized coordinate data with proper scaling
2. Batch export functionality allows processing multiple templates/content sets simultaneously
3. Export preview shows Unity coordinate mapping before actual export
4. Export format supports Unity prefab structure with proper asset references
5. Performance optimization analyzes content complexity and suggests Unity-specific improvements
6. Export validation ensures compatibility with Unity AR Foundation requirements
7. Integration with existing ARContent interface maintains backward compatibility
8. Export history tracking allows reverting to previous export configurations
9. Real-time Unity coordinate preview during content editing

## Technical Context from Architecture

### Key Technologies
- **React:** 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.5.3
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4.1 
- **Build:** Vite 6.3.5
- **Drag/Drop:** React Draggable 4.4.6 (maintained for free-form mode)
- **Resize:** React Resizable 3.0.5 (maintained for free-form mode)
- **Icons:** Lucide React 0.344.0

### Integration Requirements
- Build upon Epic-1's template system foundation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing ARContent data structure
- Support Unity coordinate system for 3D positioning
- Integrate with Google Drive APIs for asset storage
- Follow existing React patterns and component organization

### Epic-1 Dependencies
- Template and TemplateSlot interfaces from `types/templates.ts`
- TemplateSelector component in `components/templates/`
- LayoutModeToggle component functionality
- Enhanced StepPreview with template mode support
- Existing Unity coordinate system integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All template library management features working with categorization and search
- [ ] Content workflow assistant provides guided creation with validation
- [ ] Advanced Unity export system generates optimized coordinate data
- [ ] All Epic-1 functionality preserved and enhanced
- [ ] Code follows existing React/TypeScript patterns
- [ ] Components are properly exported and importable
- [ ] No regression in existing drag/drop or template functionality
- [ ] Unity integration performance meets or exceeds Epic-1 benchmarks
- [ ] Comprehensive testing covers new features and existing compatibility

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible  
- [x] UI changes follow existing TailwindCSS patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal
- [x] Epic-1 functionality remains fully intact

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** Complexity could impact existing template system performance
- **Mitigation:** Implement features as optional enhancements with lazy loading
- **Rollback Plan:** Features are modular additions that can be disabled without affecting core Epic-1 functionality
